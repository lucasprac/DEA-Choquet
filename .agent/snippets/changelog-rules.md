# Memory & Changelog Management

## Rule
When a problem is encountered and solved, update `MEMORY.md` with:
- The problem description.
- The solution implemented.
- The date of the change.

## Purpose
`MEMORY.md` serves as a persistent changelog and long-term memory for the application's evolution.
