# Feature Engineering Structure

## Rule
Explicitly structure feature engineering and analysis around **three feature groups**.

## Configuration
- Keep the code flexible so feature groups can be configured in a list or dictionary.
- Allow dynamic assignment of inputs/outputs to these groups.

## Implementation Pattern
When defining indicators or variables:
- Group 1 (e.g., Resources/Inputs)
- Group 2 (e.g., Performance/Outputs)
- Group 3 (e.g., Results/Effectiveness)

(Note: Specific names will be provided later, but the code must support this tri-group structure).
